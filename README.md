AI CODE ANALYZER with RAG Implementation

This repository is about Analyzing code using AI
In this i used the ERPNEXT Sales Module for analyzing code using AI and created a code ANALYZER and Extractor as well
With the help of this the analyzer the code which is present in the module will be analyzed and the contents in the module will be fetched like relationships, classes etc
the extractor will extract the code dependencies and relationships of the module 
in this i have learned about the code navigation using python and i was able to understand the context and flow the analyzing process



Here i have implemented the RAG Pipeline for my existing AI Code Analyzer for ERPNEXT Sales Module
In this implementation i have used the functions like building and retrieving documents and indexes as well
here the RAG Pipeline will be able to build and retrieve the content related to the codebase and it can able to show the relationships anc dependencies of the codebase as well
In this i learned about the basics of the rag pipeline and i have came to understand the functionality of the RAG Pipline.
